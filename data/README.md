===================

### Data
The original data file is located here in **scores.json**.

### Data Normalizaton Script
Since the data file contains parts that are not normalized json (quoted strings), there is a simple shell script that uses *sed* to replace the un-quoted strings to quoted strings in **normalize_data.sh**.
