### Data
The original data file is located here, [data file](./data/scores.json).

### [Data Normalizaton Script](/data/normalize_data.sh)
Since the data file contains parts that are not normalized json (quoted strings), there is a simple shell script that uses *sed* to replace the un-quoted strings to quoted strings.
